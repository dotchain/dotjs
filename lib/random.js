// CreateRamdom is a builder for the Random class. 
//
// All builders take one parameter which is a map of services. This is
// the dependency injection mechanism.  Builder must return a class.
// Code that runs directly in the builder must not access any fields
// of the builder (so it is not possible to extend builder classes)
// but code within the class (such as the class constructor) can
// safely acess the services.
